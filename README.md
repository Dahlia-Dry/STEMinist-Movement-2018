# STEMinist-Movement-2018
Attended the September 2018 lectures and looking for some ATMEGA code / other fun stuff? You've come to the right place!

ATMEGA_Code: The java code preprogrammed into the microcontroller to run the weather station and 3 supplementary projects.  If you'd like to understand how it works, the comments should do a pretty good job of explaining.

Spirograph: Python code that uses the turtle imaging library to draw spirographs on your computer.  

Wii-Hack: Taken from Johnny Lee's Ted Talk, linked in folder.  Includes instructions for turning your computer [or any surface] into a touch screen using just a wii remote, bluetooth, and an infrared LED!

PlotNerdsOnly: Jupyter notebook intro to using matplotlib to visualize your data [you can do this with your weather station!]

CoolSims: Simulations from lecture linked here.  If you're a fellow space nerd, try running the VPython script OrbitViz.py, written by yours truly.
