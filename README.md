# STEMinist-Movement-2018
Attended the September 2018 lectures and looking for some ATMEGA code / other fun stuff? You've come to the right place!

ATMEGA_Code: The java code preprogrammed into the microcontroller to run the weather station, weather station upgrades 1 and 2, and 3 supplementary projects.  If you'd like to understand how it works, the comments should do a pretty good job of explaining.

Spirograph: Python code that uses the turtle imaging library to draw spirographs on your computer.  

Wii-Hack: Taken from Johnny Lee's Ted Talk, linked in folder.  Includes instructions for turning your computer [or any surface] into a touch screen using just a wii remote, bluetooth, and an infrared LED!

PlotNerdsOnly: Jupyter notebook intro to using matplotlib to visualize your data in python.  Includes code to do this with your weather station! [arduino required]

CoolSims: Simulations from lecture linked here.  If you're a fellow space nerd, try running the VPython script OrbitViz.py, written by yours truly.

Packet: In case you've lost the packet but somehow still remembered the URL of this repository.

HOW TO RUN PYTHON FILES (.PY):                                                                                    
First, you need to install python.  You might already have it on your computer, check first.
A good source (from the website of the book that I learned python from): https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html  
Once you learn how to navigate your OS's terminal, it's as simple as navigating to the folder that your .py file is in and typing "python [FILENAME].py".  Plenty of good tutorials available on the internet as well.                           
If you get to the point where you'd like to start writing your own code in python, I highly recommend the free PyCharm IDE.

I write ATMEGA code using the free IDE provided by arduino.                                                               
Installation instructions (scroll to "Install the Arduino Desktop IDE"): https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage            
If you decide to buy an arduino, you can program your ATMEGA through USB using standard ardiuno procedures.                   
If you want to get into java, I use the free IntelliJ IDE, but Eclipse is the one that most people use.
